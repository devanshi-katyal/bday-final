    <p>Hiiii Khushi!
    <br />I've known you for 7 years now. From classmates back in 7th to really close friends now, we've come a long way. ❤️ Padhai ka rona rona, pure din baithke gossip karna, chomu bachhe bankar (jo hum hain hi aur hamesha rahenge🙂) dusron ko full on judge karna, karan preeta par heated discussions aur humara unke saath love-hate relationship, jab aapke do dost lad rahe ho toh side se nikal lena (shhhhh!) aur bahut harkatein ki hai tere saath. 😂
    <br />Tera hot bearded men ka obsession (jinhe aap roz mandir jaate time taadti hain 😏😉), doggos ke upar fangirling (want! 🐕❤️), naye naye serials ki khoj aur inke insta binge watches ke baad merko dikhwana, celebs se apni comments like karvana (sehban aapko miss kar raha hoga🤭), creeps ko handle karna (you go gurlll💖), posts ke liye never-ending caption search, stories daalke puchna ki "theek hai, hataun kya?" (overthinking 💯) , make-up demos (eye shadows 😍😍😍) sab dekha hai maine. And this is what makes you you - the wonderful person you are and always will be. I don't really say lovey-dovey things but trust me you mean a lot to me. Dhanyavad mere tante sehne ke liye 🙏🏻🙃
    <br />Wishing you a very happy birthday! ❤️
    <br />Ek baat aur tujhe gussa hona nahi aata...bilkul. 😂
    <br />Ab khush ho jaa itna likh diya 😂 Dekh rahi hai kitne cringe emojis daale hain hayee raam🙈😂💕
    <br />Bye ja ab.
    <br />Aapki pyaari sakhi and bestie</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday Khushi aka two minutes...
    <br>We have been friends for the longest time and I hope we will continue being the same for ever more. Those jokes we made, the pastas we shared,  all the fun times we had doing projects, making codes, and above all talking are fond memories for me.  School was never fun without you. You made my days fun.... Seatmates forever 🥰🥰
    <br>We have now gone from seatmates to metro friends. But chalega. Hard times....
    <br>Anyways, wishing you a very happy 19th birthday khushi....
    <br>Stay the same sweety...
    <br>Miss you loads..</p>

    <p>Happiest birthday Khushi!💫
    <br />I know it sucks to have a birthday during the lockdown but i hope you get flustered by all the wishes you get today!  You're a really great human and a greater friend! I always remember you from the 'spot round' day😂 when we were all anxious about getting a seat wherever we could! And from there it has been an amazing year with you! I must say you're a very ambitious and competitive woman! The desire of always doing the best inside you is what makes you special! I hope you achieve all what you want and most importantly i wish you a life filled with peace and happiness.
    Wishing you a super productive and the happiest year ahead! Happy Birthday.❤️</p>
